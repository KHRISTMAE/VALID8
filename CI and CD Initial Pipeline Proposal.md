CI/CD Pipeline Proposal â€“ GitHub Actions
Overview
This CI/CD pipeline aims to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring smooth and efficient delivery from development to production. Using GitHub Actions, the team can maintain continuous integration and deployment within the same repository.

Workflow Components
Continuous Integration (CI)

Trigger: On every push or pull request to the main or develop branches.
Steps:
Checkout repository.
Install dependencies (npm install / pip install / etc.).
Run code linters and formatters.
Execute unit and integration tests.
Build the application.
Continuous Deployment (CD)

Trigger: Successful CI build on the main branch.
Steps:
Build Docker image (if applicable).
Push Docker image to container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry).
Deploy to staging environment.
Run end-to-end (E2E) tests on staging.
Manual approval (optional) for production deployment.
Deploy to production environment.
Environment Configuration

Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data like API keys, tokens, and database credentials.
Separate configurations for development, staging, and production environments.
Notifications

Integrate with Slack or Email to notify the team about build failures or successful deployments.
